# TODO
sjflsdfk
Near-term, actionable items. Full staged plan:
`.claude/rules/litastum-roadmap.md`. Design for the items below:
`ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Stage 3 UI pass (in order — see ARCHITECTURE.md "suggested implementation order")

- [x] `theme.rs` — color constants from `.claude/rules/litastum-ui-theme.md`
- [x] Column-major `Panel` navigation (`columns` field, row/col index math)
- [x] `ui.rs`: replace `List` with a manual column-major grid renderer
- [x] `keymap.rs` + `command.rs` — extract key resolution/execution out of `main.rs::handle_event`
- [x] Wire Left/Right column movement through the new command layer

## Built-in editor (F4, `editor.rs`, `edtui`) — MVP + syntax highlighting landed, gaps left

- [x] Confirm-before-discard prompt when closing (`Esc`) with unsaved
      changes — `Mode::ConfirmDiscard`, `editor_keymap::resolve_confirm_discard`
- [x] Syntax highlighting (`edtui`'s `syntax-highlighting` feature,
      `syntect`-backed) — switched engines from `tui-textarea` to
      `edtui` with our own non-modal keymap to get this; see
      [[litastum-stack]] for the full story and lessons learned
- [ ] Handle non-UTF-8 / binary files without just silently doing
      nothing on F4 — at least a status-bar message once one exists
- [ ] Ctrl+V over an active selection doesn't replace it (clears the
      selection, then pastes at the cursor instead) — `edtui`'s real
      "paste over selection" action isn't publicly exported; see
      [[litastum-stack]]
- [ ] Undo is per-character (`capture_on_insert: true`), not grouped by
      typing burst like most editors — `EditorState::capture` being
      crate-private forecloses implementing our own grouping; see
      [[litastum-stack]]
- [ ] `onig` (a C library, via `syntect`'s default features) is now a
      transitive dependency — built fine locally, but is this project's
      first non-pure-Rust dependency; watch for build issues on
      environments without a C toolchain — see [[litastum-stack]]

## RESOLVED: Ctrl+S / Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V / Ctrl+X (2026-09-04)

Confirmed working after splitting editor key resolution into
`editor_keymap.rs` (mirroring `keymap.rs`/`command.rs`) and adding
`logging.rs`. Root cause was never pinned down with certainty (the fix
landed together with the uppercase-letter match and the mode-borrow
restructuring in `main.rs::handle_editor_key`) — if a similar "key does
nothing" report comes up again, `logs/litastum.log` now has `debug!` on
every key event and resolved command in both modes, and `warn!`
specifically when `arboard::Clipboard::new()` fails, to make it
diagnosable without guessing.

The logging infrastructure stays (`logging.rs`, size-capped at 30 MB —
see `SizeCappedFile`) for the next time something like this happens.

## Theming (`scheme.rs`, `config.rs`) — landed, gaps left

Windows Terminal-format color schemes drive the app's interface
(panels, borders, F-key bar, ...) and the editor's syntax highlighting
*independently* — `config.json`'s `interface_theme` and `editor_theme`
keys, matching how Far Manager itself keeps those two systems separate.
See [[litastum-theming]] for the full design and the mapping
conventions.

- [x] F9 in-app theme picker (`theme_menu.rs`) — lists `themes/*.json`,
      applies live (no restart) and persists to `config.json`. A
      minimal analog of Far Manager's F9 menu, scoped to just color
      schemes — not the real Left/Files/Commands/Options/... top-menu
      bar, see "F9 menu" below
- [ ] No hot-reload when a theme *file itself* is edited on disk while
      running (roadmap stage 5 territory, `notify` crate) — F9 re-scans
      the `themes/` directory each time it opens, but doesn't watch it
- [ ] Real terminal cursor *color* isn't driven by `cursorColor` (only
      shape is themed) — needs an OSC 12 escape sequence crossterm
      doesn't wrap
- [x] File-type coloring (`panel.rs::HighlightRole`) — archives,
      executables/scripts, and VCS metadata dirs (`.git`/`.svn`/`.hg`/
      `.bzr`) get distinct colors, Far Manager-style; reverses an
      earlier "no file-type color dots" decision (see
      [[litastum-theming]]) per explicit later request. Ordinary
      directories are *not* colored — checked against a real Far
      screenshot, only VCS dirs actually stood out there. Added
      `Theme::success`/`warning` (from the original "color 2" plan,
      only `danger` had actually landed before) to drive it
- [ ] `ColorScheme`'s `black`/`white`/most `bright*` fields are parsed
      but not yet consumed by `to_theme`/`to_syntax_theme` — dead code
      (`cargo build` warns on this), kept for format fidelity and
      future mapping expansion, same situation as `Entry::size`/
      `modified` below

## F9 menu — minimal color-scheme picker landed, real menu still to do

`theme_menu.rs` is deliberately *only* a theme picker, not a real F9
top-menu bar (Far Manager's own F9 is Left/Files/Commands/Options/
View/Right, each with submenus). Gaps if this grows toward that:

- [ ] Ctrl+V-over-selection replacing text, syntax highlighting for a
      *currently open* editor when its theme changes live — out of
      scope for the picker itself, listed here only because "apply
      live" doesn't retroactively re-theme an already-open `Editor`
      (the new `editor_theme` applies to the next file opened)
- [ ] No preview while browsing the list — colors only change once
      applied (Enter/I/E), not as you move the cursor over each name
- [ ] Long theme lists aren't scrolled, just clamped to the terminal
      height — fine for a handful of files, not for many

## Next up

- [ ] Show item count / free space in each panel's footer (mockup has
      this; not yet in `Panel`/`ui.rs`)
- [ ] Use `Entry::size`/`Entry::modified` for something, or drop them —
      currently dead code (`cargo build` warns on this)

## Housekeeping

- [ ] `Cargo.toml`: replace `YOUR_USERNAME` placeholder in `repository`
